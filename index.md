### Coding manifesto

#### Get to the first production version with as little effort as possible
Right now I may *think* I know what I am doing. However, I really do not. 

For this reason, I should get to the first version with as little effort as possible.

This means I should build the first code version of any project with (in order of importance):

##### As simple code as possible (simple beats DRY)
Simple code beats clever code - this is doubly true for the first version! Clever code may be easier to extend / adapt, but it is harder to *fundamentally* change. The likelihood is very high that I will have to fundamentally change the first version of any project.

##### As little code as possible
Right now I may *think* I know what I am doing, but *I really don't*. Therefore I should get to the first version with as little effort as possible. This means I should not waste time on clever code.

Get to the first version with as little effort as possible.
